## ðŸš€ Personal Portfolio â€” What I Made

A clean, responsive, developer portfolio packed with animations, interactivity, and subtle sarcasm. Built using:

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
- **Next.js 15** â€” The latest and greatest!
- **TypeScript** â€” Because I like errors at compile time, not runtime.
- **Material UI (MUI)** â€” For beautiful components and less CSS headache.
- **Framer Motion** â€” To make things move... because static is boring.
- **React Hot Toast** â€” Toasts that actually look cool.
- **Formspree** â€” So strangers can email meâ€¦ responsibly.

### ðŸŽ¨ Features:
âœ… Smooth scrolling navigation with active state  
âœ… Animated text headers and dynamic sections  
âœ… Interactive flipping card with rotating prompts  
âœ… Fully functional contact form with email delivery  
âœ… Responsive mobile-friendly navbar with a drawer menu  
âœ… Flying plane animation on form submit (because why not?)  
âœ… Downloadable resume link powered by `.env` (no token leaks, promise)  
âœ… Easter egg excuses hidden in buttons (blame the dev for unfinished parts)
